Questions

What is the nature of the final website?

I had my original code in python, access a url to download csv file with corresponding
country code that was entered. It takes that information into a list of lists, and outputs the top 10 items in that list.

i realised that two issues
-i have to use js instead of python
    -Im having soem issues with getting data from the csv, it might be missing some of it,
    -how to get it to return a certain number of items from array
    -would it make sense to have country codes in the drop down vs full counrty names, and then returning corresponding  counrty code

-spotify API verification was not possible with the final website as it wont be live.
    -explain the workaround i have come up with and inquire about any better/alternative solutions
