            <p>This website uses features from Spotify Developers as well as data from Spotify Charts to introduce users to popular music in other countries.</p>
            <p>So they can see the differences in the popular music preferences of people around the world in an easier way.</p>
            <p>Because as of right now the Spotify app does not offer stats or constantly updating playlists with this information.</p>
            <p>The creator made this site as final project for IST263.</p>
